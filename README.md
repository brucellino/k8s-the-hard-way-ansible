# k8s-the-hard-way-ansible

An implementation in Ansible of Kubernetes the Hard Way by the OG -- Kelsey Hightower.

## Only Ansible

This is an exercise.
I have set myself the constraint of using only Ansible for implementing the solution.
Any Ansible modules are permitted.

### Pragmatic Ansible

This is not intended to show perfect abstraction, but to implement a solution.
I adopt a pragmatic approach to using Ansible by first writing simple playbooks, then abstracting and encapsulation bits into roles.

## Digital Ocean

The deployment is done on Digital Ocean using droplets.
Obviously, since we are doing things the hard way, we do not use managed services so DOKS is out.
